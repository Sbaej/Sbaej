# # Finding the most profitable apps for apple store and google play market
# 

# My aim in this project is to find the most profitable apps for apple store and goofle play market. to achieved that I filtered the apps, deleted unnecessary duplicates, deleted non english apps, because I'm interested only in english apps and wanted to find out what genres are the most profitable.

# As we mentioned in the introduction, our aim is to determine the kinds of apps that are likely to attract more users because our revenue is highly influenced by the number of people using our apps.
# 
# To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:
# 
# 1.Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
# 
# 2.If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.
# 
# 3.If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.

# So as we can see the most popular category will be hard to succeed, because it's dominated by few giants and will be very hard to gain any market share. The next most populat category is games, but in my opinion this is category that will be also hard to succeed, because there are thousands of games already in the market. The books and reference genre looks fairly popular as well, with an average number of installs of 8,767,811 so we will take a closer look at this category because it's quite unique.

# As we can see there are few big players in this area, but there are also some less recognizable names that are doing good.
# However like almost with every thing market is full of ebooks so we will need take diffrent approach maybe focus on some quotes from books or focus just on one book and gather fans of this title in one place.

# # Conclusions

# Based on my anlysis I think that Books and Reference category is the best for new apps. There is still niche in this market but I recommend try to focus mainly on specific book rather than on popular thing like ebooks.

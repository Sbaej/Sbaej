In my first project I'm trying to show basic things in python

Machine learning and Sharpe Ratio projects
These two projects were created on data camp website. It's means that all the important part (code) in 100% was made by me but, all the descriptions were already made by datacamp.

The forth one is using rnn to predict bitcoin price project as in title is using recurrent neural networks especially lstm to try predict is it worth buy bitcoin or no.
